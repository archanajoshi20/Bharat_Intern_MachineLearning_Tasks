# Machne Learning Tasks

By Archana Joshi

In Task 1, the goal is to develop a machine-learning model for house price prediction using linear regression. The code begins by importing necessary libraries, uploading a housing dataset, and performing data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and exploring data characteristics. The dataset is then split into features and target variables, followed by creating and training a Linear Regression model. The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics like MAE, MSE, and RMSE, allowing for predictions of house prices.


Task 2 involves classifying Iris flowers based on petal and sepal measurements. The code imports essential libraries, loads the Iris dataset, and explores its attributes. It also visualizes data relationships using scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, histograms, and pair plots. The dataset is further transformed to create a binary target variable indicating flower quality. Features are prepared, and the dataset is split into training and testing sets. Several classification models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Naive Bayes, are trained and evaluated based on accuracy.
